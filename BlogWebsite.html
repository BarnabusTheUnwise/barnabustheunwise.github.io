	I was raised on computers, in everything but the literal sense. Ever since I was young my dad would let me sit on his lap as he took out his dusty 1992 Dell Laptop and would boot up Age of Empires or Civilization or, my favorite, Lord of the Realms 2. A collection of games that would serve to both kindle my love for history and my love for video games. Alongside this came a kind of lifelong commitment that at some point I would give back to the form of media that really sparked joy in younger me. I eventually plan to grow this website into something of an interactive game, using a sort of mini blog as a means to both document my various hobbies and tinkerings and to relearn CSS and HTML.
	
	My first attempts at learning HTML went just about as well as anyone would expect from a middle schooler who barely knew his lefts from his rights. What it eventually culminated in, if my memory serves me, was a single smiley face JPG pulled off of google and pasted onto a blue background. The smiley face was, and never would have been, transparent. To me it was the thrill of the game, I could say that I knew how to and could rest of my laurels. I never would come back to gild that lilly, but I'd like to consider this me doing my younger self justice. I've made gifs, custom cursors, and hopefully soon to be embedded objects to say, finally, that I know what I'm doing. Depending on when this gets out it may be rough around the edges, it may be ugly, but it will have infinitely more sense and sensibility than existed in every cell in 12 year old me's head.
	
	Either way, the proof is in the taste of the pudding, so I feel I should go over the technical side. I'm approaching this from the same angle I approach most of my coding: I understand the basic principles, as well has how to google "custom cursor image html" with the best of them. It is said we stand on the shoulders of giants, and none is more evident in showing that than the beauty of StackOverflow and its various offshoots. 
	
	And just for reference, when I say I learned HTML as a kid it means I learned how to press CTRL-SHIFT-I on a webpage. I have fond memories of doing the notPr0n puzzles with two good friends of mine, to those who know what that was, and I hope that in time this can become a similar sort of project. A never ending rabbit hole where I can put the misfiring neurons in my brain to use.
