	Hitbox as a brand is akin to Kleenex for alot of people. A name that took over the product it created. The company makes what are known more generally as leverless controllers, that is arcade sticks without the stick, or lever. The goal was to make an ergonomic, keyboard-like controller for mainly fighting games (street fighter and the like), where quick reactions and accurate inputs are paramount.
	
	As such, in being the brand to define their product as well as that product being sensitive electronics, I elected to not spend the $250+ that it would cost to grab one. Luckily, thanks to the help of some open source programmers it's all possible to make a bootleg hitbox, and with not a hint of legal repercussions. It will be a bit less sturdy but significantly more customizable
	
	Seen below is a hitbox as you would see it on the shelf. Colorless and a bit lame, sure, but functional
