	Step 3: Google Like a Madman
	
	The most important part of all this has been an ability to find what I need via Google. I'm new to this. I assume you, the reader are as well.

	There is a quantity of people out there who have done all this for the last 30+ years
	
	I've probably googled "image padding HTML" 4 or 5 times already. I could probably do it from memory now, but I'll probably end up googling it again. It takes a long time to acquire skills, and this should be far from an exception
	
	Start googling how to do cool things. Do things that keep you engaged. I wanted a wizard theme, wanted to make a gif of a wizard tower with clouds over it. Took me two google searches and half an hour of microsoft paint work but now look, I can paste this wherever I want to
	
	Creation is a long process and you should go about it in a manner that keeps you wanted to learn. I struggle to see the light at the tunnel with these kinds of projects, and little treats to myself like a custom cursor just scratch that part of my brain right.
