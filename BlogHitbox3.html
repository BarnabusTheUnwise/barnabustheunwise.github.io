	Now that you have your stuff, here's the assembly
	
Step 1: Either print out the box, or drill holes in your box as required
		Prefered layouts are usually 4 movement buttons, 8 action buttons, and 3 option buttons. Depending on the game/character, this can vary. Size of holes, if drilling, should match the diameter of the inner screw ring of the buttons purchased
		
Step 2: Place buttons into top of case/cardboard box/etc.
		They'll either snap in or screw in depending on the build. As long as they're in there firmly you're good for Step 3

Step 3: The Great Soldering Part 1
	It is best practice to measure here, but it is not necessary. For each prong on any button (there should be 2 per), you need a wire that reaches from said prong to the pico, with some slack. Each of these wires must then be stripped about a quarter inch on each side.
	
	Place each wire on each respective prong, hold the soldering iron up against where they meet, and then feed in solder until it melts. Watch your hands, they may get hot, and I definitely recommend watching a tutorial online somewhere. Each should have a black wire on one and any color (red or at least organized). Which gets which does not matter.

Step 3: The Great Soldering Part 2
	Find your buttons, and figure out where each is going using the image below. I firmly will recommend matching the standard hitbox, that is movement on the left, big button for thumb is jump, 8 action buttons for right hand. From here, simply match them up and solder them through the holes of the board. Ensure that the solder does not flow between two holes on the board.
	
	Next, and probably the most frustrating part, is to ground everything. Due to limited space, each ground hole needs to fit two black wires per to wire it all together. Where does not matter, the grounds are all connected internally. You could in fact, solder all the wires together in one big ball on the end and connect that to one ground if that's easier. Do not do this.

Step 4: Sealing the Deal
	Hard part is over. All that's left is to plug in the cable, strap a ziptie around it as tight as possible near where it exits the box (to prevent unplugging by accident), and to seal it all together.
	
	Congrats! you now have a box with buttons. How to bring it to life? GP2040-CE has you covered. Simply download the file below, plug the box in to your computer, drag the file into the box's removable disc on your file explorer, and let it auto disconnect. That's it.
	
	Slap on some stickers, paint it up, you have a hitbox. Launch it in your game of choice, make sure the buttons work, and get ready to cry when one or two aren't fully soldered down. Ouch.
