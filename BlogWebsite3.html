	Step 2: Creating an HTML file
	
	To begin this process I'd recommend starting with the blankest template possible, though it depends what you're trying to accomplish. I wanted to lean heavily into 90's looks so I just copied one that had the tags I needed to start typing and see results
	
	Below I've linked one similar to what I started with, though I'd even recommend just copying any one of these pages and tooling around with values to see what's generally going on
	
	The main thing to remember is that for every <> you need a </>, in a manner of speaking. If you've coded before otherwise, think of them like the effects of a loop, and think of the things within the first <> as the conditions, or effects
	
	Also good to know is that if you keep all your images and webpages in one folder they'll reference eachother beautifully
